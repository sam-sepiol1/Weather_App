# Weather App 

## Project Overview

This project allows the user to search for a city and provides the weather for the city. 

## How does it work ? 

This app is built with HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

When a search is performed, the app calls to my personnal API. My API fetches data from openweathermap and returns the weather data. 
Data is then displayed on the app with JavaScript.

## Functionnality

The app display a search bar and the user types the city they want. They have two options 

Search : search and display the weather. 
Compare : search adn display the weather without replacing the previous search.
